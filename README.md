Landing page for Zotbins project (https://zotbins.github.io/)

Includes
  - student team (ZerO Waste Anteaters or ZOWA)
  - staff advisors at UCI
  - project alumni
  - project photos

Notes
  - I recommend running a prettify script to make sure the code is tidy and neat.
    - In particular, if you are using the Sublime text editor, download and run the HTML-CSS-JS script.
